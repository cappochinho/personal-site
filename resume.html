            <h3>Prepaid Ebilling</h3>
            <p>The focus of this project was to design, implement and deploy a prepaid version of the existing ebilling software. The software allows users to make payments virtually and a recharge is performed on their meters based on their payments.</p>

            <h3>Gold Mine SCADA Deployment</h3>
            <p>The focus of this project was to design a SCADA interface for a new gravity circuit for a renowned Gold Mine. This system allows plant operators to monitor and control the operation of the new gravity circuit as well as integrating existing SCADA and HMI interface into the new SCADA interface. </p>

            <h3>Postpaid Ebilling</h3>
            <p>This project was focused on developing a system that enables the billing of both energy meters and water meters. My role in this project was to implement the design for the communication of the meters in a custom software. This software allowed the client to view the consumption of the meters and generate bills for consumers connected to the system. </p>
